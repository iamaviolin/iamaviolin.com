        <p>Hi there/Hall√∂chen/‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºÅüëã</p>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm a live sound engineer from California, now based in Berlin,
          Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though I‚Äôve tried on various hats in the music industry, I'm currently
          focused on mixing concerts/events and helping performers sound their
          best onstage. In recent years I‚Äôve had the pleasure of touring
          internationally as a FOH/Monitor engineer and playback engineer. 
          Otherwise, I am troubleshooting technical issues at Ableton. Previously, 
          I studied violin performance and audio production, and graduated from 
          Berklee College of Music in 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
          Representation in event technology has some ways to go. I've been
          working with local sound crew Soundsysters to teach and support
          FLINTA* people interested in audio.
